# Contributing to Awesome UniFi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this curated list of awesome UniFi tools and resources!

## Guidelines

### Adding a new item

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. **Relevance**: The project must be specifically related to UniFi or Ubiquiti networking products. Generic networking tools that happen to work with UniFi do not qualify unless they have specific UniFi integration.

2. **Quality**: The project should be:
   - Well documented with a clear README
   - Actively maintained (or clearly marked as archived/unmaintained if historically significant)
   - Have at least 10 stars on GitHub (exceptions may be made for unique tools)

3. **Format**: Use the following format:
   ```markdown
   - [project-name](https://github.com/owner/project-name) - A short description (X stars)
   ```

4. **Placement**: Add new items to the appropriate category in alphabetical order by project name.

5. **Description**: Keep descriptions:
   - Concise (one line)
   - Focused on what the project does
   - Starting with a capital letter
   - Without a period at the end

### Categories

If you think a new category is needed:
- First check if your item fits in an existing category
- New categories should have at least 3-5 items
- Categories should be specific to UniFi/Ubiquiti ecosystem

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes
